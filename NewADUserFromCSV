Use following brief to complete this project via PowerShell

    Create a PowerShell function within PowerShell ISE
        only use Parameters for information input, the function must run without interruption
        use a parameter for the CSV file,
            make sure the parameter has a default value for the path to the "e:\NewHires.csv" file
        Save the function as a module in an autoloading directory ($env:PSModulePath will list the correct directories to choose from)
        Test the new PowerShell command you have created

What must the PowerShell function achieve

    Use the NewHires.csv file to create the new employees Active Directory
    Check first to see if OUs and Groups exist for all of the users that will be created
        if not, have the PowerShell create OUs and Global Security Groups for any departments that are missing
    Use Powershell to create each of these new users (from the NewHires.csv file)
        Each user must
            Be created within the OU relating to their department
            Be added to the Security Group that relates to their department
            Have the unique password (found in the NewHires.csv file) set for their user account
            Have all of the AD properties added as per the NewHires.csv file
            Have the AD property called "SamAccountName" created comprising of the First letter of the FirstName and the LastName combined, all in lowercase
                for example "FirstName = Ben, LastName = Smith",
                you will need to use an AD property called, "SamAccountName" that have the value "bsmith"
            Have the AD Property called "Name" created which consists of "FirstName LastName"
                for example "FirstName = Ben, LastName = Smith",
                you will need to use an AD property called, "Name" that have the value "Ben Smith"

Test if your function worked by running:

# If your function worked this will show users within the contractors group
Get-ADGroupMember -Identity Contractors
